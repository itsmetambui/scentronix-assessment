We want you to create this component using the following tools:

![example-gif](https://gitlab.com/scentronix/assessments/web-interviews/-/raw/master/fullstack/images/design-system.gif)
![example-mobile|320x550](https://gitlab.com/scentronix/assessments/web-interviews/-/raw/master/fullstack/images/design-system-mobile.png)
![example-desktop|320x569](https://gitlab.com/scentronix/assessments/web-interviews/-/raw/master/fullstack/images/design-system-desktop.png)

Everything is done through git, so to share this project we would like you to send us a git repo on for example like Github/Gitlab etc.

We would like you to use [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) as a start for this assignment, and in our apps we use [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com]) as a base for our components.

Create a few pages like this with different kind of text and link them together in the menu.

Have MUI as a base for the components and incorperate the best way to have the animations how its shown in the design.

Have the component be responsive on Desktop and Mobile

Icons you can use either random from the internet or other packages.
